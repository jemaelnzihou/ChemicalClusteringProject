# 💧 Fluid and Particle Dynamics: Visualizing the Engine Behind Chemical Engineering Systems

## 📘 Overview

This project brings to life the core principles of **fluid and particle dynamics** using **Python visualizations and simulations**. It is based on insights from the paper:

📄 **Fluid and Particle Dynamics: The Engine Behind Chemical Engineering Systems**  
🔗 Inspired by Section 6 of the *Chemical Engineering Handbook*.

This repository aims to:
- Bridge the gap between **theory and practice**
- Offer **interactive tools and visualizations**
- Make the invisible science behind **flow, mixing, separation, and energy transfer** visible and understandable

## 🎯 Project Goals

- 📊 **Visualize** fundamental fluid dynamics equations like Bernoulli’s, Reynolds Number, and the Navier-Stokes model.
- 🧪 **Simulate** laminar and turbulent regimes to help chemical engineers understand how these forces operate in real systems.
- 💡 **Connect** mathematical models to real-world scenarios—like plumbing, medical devices, reactors, and air conditioning.
- 🌍 **Educate** students, professionals, and curious minds about the critical role of flow dynamics in everyday and industrial life.

## 🧠 Core Concepts Covered

* **Reynolds Number**
  Understand laminar vs. turbulent flow using:

  $$
  Re = \frac{\rho v D}{\mu}
  $$

* **Bernoulli’s Equation**
  See energy conservation across pressure, velocity, and elevation:

  $$
  P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho g h = \text{constant}
  $$

* **Navier-Stokes (Intro)**
  Understand flow fields in CFD foundations.
